# Portsmouth Press

Portsmouth Press is an uppercase display typeface created by Gleb Redko in Portsmouth, UK, using vintage wood type blocks from the historic Barrett 1812 letterpress â€” one of only three known surviving presses of its kind worldwide.

Each letter was manually printed on paper with oil paint using the Barrett press, then digitised to preserve the raw texture and mechanical charm of early industrial printing.

This typeface is bold, tactile, and ideal for titling, signage, or visual work that benefits from a strong physical presence rooted in typographic history.
