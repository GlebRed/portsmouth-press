<p><strong>Portsmouth Press</strong> is an uppercase display font created by Gleb Redko in Portsmouth, UK, using wood type blocks printed with oil paint on a Barrett 1812 letterpressâ€”one of only three remaining in the world. The font preserves the tactile texture and irregularity of early industrial printing.</p>
