<p><strong>Portsmouth Press</strong> is an uppercase display typeface created by Gleb Redko using vintage wood type blocks. The letters were manually printed on paper with a letterpress and oil paint, then digitised to retain the raw texture and imperfections of physical impression. Bold and tactile, it’s designed for striking titles, signage, and posters.</p>
